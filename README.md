# Employee Tracker (UCF BOOTCAMP CHALLENGE 12)

An employee tracker program that keeps employee information in a sql database and can be manipulated by a user through the command line.

## Description
The employee tracked application is a program that keeps track of employees in a sql database. The challange in the bootcamp required that we used inquirer, node and MySql to created a progam that will display an employee database. 

The employee tracker lists the current departments, positions, and employees with the company. It can also add a new department, add a new position, add a new employee, or update an employee in the system. 

The program can also be improved in the furture by having the ability to delete data from the categories listed above. The code also does not follow DRY principles and can be looked at again for modularization.
